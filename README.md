# OpenCraft

OpenCraft is a quick experiment using an ERC-1155 to implement an on-chain crafting feature.

Please view the working prototype at: [https://www.opencraft.io](https://www.opencraft.io/) _(Ropsten network only)_

## How It Works

Users mint materials, and then craft items (pretty simple). In the future I plan to expand this to something more useful.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Smart Contract??

This repo only contains code for the Next JS client application. I will upload this in the future, but I can assure you it's pretty simple.
